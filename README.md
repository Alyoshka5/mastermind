The goal of the game is to guess the 4 color code that the code maker has created.
There are 8 valid colors to guess from: red, green, blue, yellow, brown, orange.
After every guess, the code maker will give you (the code breaker) feedback based on your choices and his code.
Red means that one of the colors is in the code and the correct spot,
white means one of the colors is in the code but in the wrong spot,
and black means one of the colors is not in the code.

Player can chose to be either the code maker or the code breaker
